# What is Container?
    - A container is a lightweight package that contains an application's code, libraries, configuration files, and dependencies. Containers are a type of virtualization that allow applications to be moved between environments while retaining functionality. This makes containers a good solution for applications that may fail to run correctly when moved from one environment to another.
